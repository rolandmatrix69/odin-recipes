                <li>2 Cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>2 fingers of ginger</li>
              </ul>
          <h2>Preparations</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>Season the chicken/beef with a teapoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.</p>
                <p>Set on Heat and let it boil for 10- 15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 2</strong><p>Set aside the meat and stock in freh bowls. Peel pff the outer bask of the ginger/garlic, pound and grind</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Parboil the rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in pot, add the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 4</strong><p>Pick out the parboilrd tasty meat and deep fry, set aside.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 5</strong><p>Once you arer one with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml(1 cup) just add the remainng one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the blended tomatoes. Preferably cook the jollof rice with the same oil I used while frying the meat.</p><p>Using a fresh oil is just the same ascooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually holds over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most nigerian foods.</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 6</strong><p>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes</p><p>Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon.</p><p>You'll also notice the tomatoes turning dark</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 7</strong><p>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/ beef stock) to the fried tomatoin the pot, the blended ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.</p><p>Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Don't worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance</p></li>
                <li><strong>Step 8</strong><p>Add the rice</p><p>Then cover and allow to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water occasionally.</p><p>Voila!!!</p></li>
